      <div class="submission-content">
        <p class="guidelines">All paper submissions will be handled electronically. Papers must be
          submitted electronically in DOC format at easychair. Submitted papers
          must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that
          are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings.
          Submitted papers will be peerreviewed and carefully evaluated based on
          originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.
          The submitted papers must be between 4-6 pages. To facilitate the paper’s
          double-blind peer review process, authors should make efforts to ensure that
          information about the authors’ identities do not appear anywhere in the
          text-body of the paper and must follow the guidelines. Upon acceptance,
          at least one of the authors listed in the paper must submit the final paper,
          attend the conference and present the paper according to the schedule of the conference.
          In the event that the presenter is unable to attend the conference for any
          reasons, your accepted paper will not be considered for submission of the
          proceeding to the IEEE Xplore. Accepted papers after further revisions will be
          invited for publications in selected journals. Please direct any questions about
          the paper submission process to the program chair at ict4m@iium.edu.my.
          </p>
          <p class="noshowpolicy">No Show Policy</p>
          <p class="noshowpolicydetails">Papers that are accepted must be presented at the conference, either by the authors themselves or via a proxy.
          In case a paper is not presented at the conference, it shall be deemed a ‘no-show’. Only presented papers
          will be submitted for indexing. No refund of the paid fees may be claimed by the ‘no-show’ author.
